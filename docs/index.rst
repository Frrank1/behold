Behold: Python debugging for large projects
===========================================

Behold is a package that let's you perform contextual debugging. You can use the
state inside one module to either trigger a step debugger or trigger print
statements in a completely different module. Given the stateful nature of many
large, multi-file applications (I'm looking at you, Django), this capability
provides valuable control over your debugging work flow.

Behold is written in pure Python with no dependencies. It is compatible with
both Python2 and Python3.

See the 
`Github project page <https://github.com/robdmc/behold>`_.
for examples of how to use `behold`.
